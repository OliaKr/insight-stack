# InsightStack ‚Äì Cross-Department Report Analysis

**InsightStack** is an AI-powered system that provides strategic insights based on multi-departmental reports. This application leverages AI agents to analyze reports from different business departments, such as Sales, Support, and Operations, and provides actionable insights in a user-friendly dashboard. The application is powered by Azure OpenAI and built with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), providing a robust foundation for AI-driven analysis.

## Overview:

Provides businesses with strategic insights by analyzing reports from various departments. The application integrates advanced AI models from Azure OpenAI and utilizes Autogen AgentChat for orchestrating multi-agent collaboration.

## üîß Key Features

- üß† AI-powered insights from sales, support, and operations reports

  Provides strategic insights by analyzing reports from multiple business departments

- üì¶ MCP-compliant structure: external context via FastAPI endpoints

  Ensures seamless integration with external systems using FastAPI, compliant with the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

- ü§ñ Azure OpenAI-powered LLM inference

  Utilizes Azure OpenAI's language models for advanced inference and insights generation based on business data.

- üîÅ Fixed-role orchestration across Sales, Support, Ops, and Coordinator agents

  Each agent has a predefined role and works collaboratively to analyze different aspects of the reports.

- ‚öôÔ∏è Longtime memory integration to retain previous analysis and improve insights over time

  Stores insights and historical analysis to optimize future results.

- üß† RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

  Combines external information retrieval with generative models. RAG enhances the analysis process by retrieving relevant context from past reports or external datasets before generating insights, providing a more accurate and contextually aware output.

- üñ•Ô∏è Streamlit UI to trigger analysis and display results

  Provides a user-friendly interface for triggering analyses and viewing generated insights through an interactive dashboard.

## User Options

1.üîç Run Analysis - Triggers the process of analyzing business reports from various departments. When clicked, the agents begin their analysis of the reports (Sales, Support, and Operations) and provide actionable insights based on the data.

2.üìä View Insights- Allows users to view the strategic insights generated from the analysis of the reports. It displays the results in a clear and actionable manner, providing a summary of key findings, trends, and recommendations.

3.üß† View Memory - Lets the user access the memory of past analysis and insights. The memory feature allows the system to store and retreive past analyses to improve the accuracy and relevance of future insighs.

4.üîç View Raw Department Reports- Displays the raw, unprocessed reports from each department. It provides users with access to the original data before it has been analyzed and summarized by the AI agents, ensuring transparency and data verification.

## Technologies Used

- Azure OpenAI
- Autogen AgentChat: A framework for agent-based collaboration, which allows agents to analyze reports and collaborate autonomously.
- Streamlit: A Python library to build interactive web applications and dashboards for displaying insights
- Pandas: For managing and displaying tabular data
- Hugging Face: For model hosting and access to pre-trained models (e.g., sentence transformers for text embeddings).
- Redis: Used for storing and managing memory of past reports and insights
